# Speech Recognition Models (ASR)

This repository contains multiple models for **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, including implementations using different deep learning architectures. The goal is to explore and compare the performance of various architectures on speech-to-text tasks.

## Models Included

1. **CNN-based ASR**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture for speech recognition.
2. **RNN-based ASR**: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based architecture using LSTMs for speech-to-text conversion.
3. **Transformer-based ASR**: A Transformer-based model for sequence-to-sequence tasks in speech recognition.

## Dataset Used

The models are trained and evaluated using the **Mozilla Common Voice 13.0** dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for training speech recognition systems. The English subset of the dataset is used in this project.
